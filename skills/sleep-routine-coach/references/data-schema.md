# Data schema and deterministic rules

## Local files

Default directory:

- `SLEEP_ROUTINE_DATA_DIR` when set.
- Otherwise `$XDG_DATA_HOME/sleep-routine-coach`.
- Otherwise `~/.local/share/sleep-routine-coach`.

Files are created with best-effort directory mode `0700` and file mode `0600`:

- `profile.json`: consent and preferences.
- `sleep-records.json`: final effective records with provenance and audit history.
- `reminders.json`: reminder state; never an OpenClaw Cron database.

Do not save these files under the Skill or repository. Do not sync them externally unless the user explicitly exports and moves them.

## Record fields

Every record includes at least:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `date` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | Local session date anchored to the reported preparation-for-sleep event. |
| `timezone` | IANA string | Timezone used for this session. |
| `goodnight_at` | ISO 8601 or null | User reported preparing for sleep; not actual sleep onset. |
| `sleep_latency_minutes` | integer or null | User-reported/clarified latency, or deterministically derived from two reported timestamps. |
| `sleep_latency_category` | string or null | Raw short answer such as `quick`, `about_30`, `over_60`, or `unknown`. |
| `reported_sleep_at` | ISO 8601 or null | Direct user report of sleep onset; self-reported, not measured. |
| `estimated_sleep_at` | ISO 8601 or null | Derived from `goodnight_at + sleep_latency_minutes`. |
| `morning_at` | ISO 8601 or null | User-reported awake time; not necessarily out-of-bed time. |
| `out_of_bed_at` | ISO 8601 or null | User-reported out-of-bed time. |
| `night_awakenings` | integer or null | Reported awakenings for any reason. |
| `night_awakenings_category` | string or null | Non-exact raw choice such as `3_plus`. |
| `nocturia_count` | integer or null | Reported awakenings involving urination. |
| `nocturia_category` | string or null | Non-exact raw choice such as `3_plus`. |
| `night_awake_minutes` | integer or null | Reported total awake time after sleep onset. |
| `rested_score` | integer 0–5 or null | Optional self-rating. |
| `notes` | string or null | User-intended note only. |
| `source` | string | Record origin, normally `user_report`. |
| `created_at` | ISO 8601 | Record creation time. |
| `updated_at` | ISO 8601 | Last modification time. |

Additional derived fields:

- `reported_window_minutes`: elapsed time from goodnight to morning. Never call this sleep duration.
- `estimated_sleep_at`: derived estimate from goodnight plus latency; a direct onset report remains separately visible in `reported_sleep_at`.
- `estimated_sleep_duration_minutes`: set only when estimated sleep onset, morning time, and night-awake duration are known. `night_awakenings == 0` establishes zero night-awake duration.
- `provenance`: marks values as reported, estimated, or derived.
- `audit_history`: append-only changes within the surviving record.

Deleting a day removes that record, including its audit history. Deleting all removes every local file. Do not retain a hidden tombstone.

## Time rules

- Require offset-aware ISO 8601 timestamps.
- Store the IANA timezone separately because an offset alone does not encode future/past DST rules.
- Convert to UTC for elapsed-time arithmetic, then convert back through `zoneinfo`.
- Never add wall-clock hours directly across DST changes.
- Accept timezone changes by storing the zone on each session; do not rewrite old records automatically.
- Anchor a normal session to the local date of `goodnight_at`. If morning arrives without a matching open record, default to the previous local date and let the user correct it.
- Require explicit date/offset clarification for ambiguous fall-back times or nonexistent spring-forward wall times.

## Missing data and estimates

- Keep unknown values as JSON `null`.
- Never infer actual sleep onset from a goodnight message.
- Never infer out-of-bed time from a morning message.
- Never invent awake duration, awakening count, rested score, or notes.
- Calculate `estimated_sleep_at` only with a reported latency.
- Calculate estimated sleep duration only when both boundaries and intervening awake time are sufficiently known.
- Report all trends as descriptive associations, not causes.

## Commands

All commands accept `--data-dir`.

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/manage_profile.py init --consent \
  --timezone America/Toronto --target-wake-time 07:30 \
  --sleep-window-start 23:00 --sleep-window-end 07:30 \
  --reminder-intensity gentle --proactive-start 19:00 --proactive-end 09:00

python3 {baseDir}/scripts/record_sleep_event.py goodnight \
  --at 2026-07-29T23:06:00-04:00

python3 {baseDir}/scripts/record_sleep_event.py morning \
  --at 2026-07-30T07:32:00-04:00

python3 {baseDir}/scripts/record_sleep_event.py sleep-onset \
  --date 2026-07-29 --at 2026-07-30T01:00:00-04:00 \
  --reason "User said: I actually fell asleep at one"

python3 {baseDir}/scripts/record_sleep_event.py correct \
  --date 2026-07-29 --field sleep_latency_minutes --value 30 \
  --reason "User said about half an hour"
```

Substitute the actual Skill directory for `{baseDir}` when running outside OpenClaw.
